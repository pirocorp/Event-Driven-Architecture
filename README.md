## Modern Integration Patterns

**Integration** - An integration connects data, applications, and services across our estate. Common integration methods are **files**, **messages** and **APIs**

**Integration Pattern** - An integration pattern is a standardized method for implementing integrations. Common patterns are **point-to-point**, **publish/subscribe**, and **request/response**.
